/**
 * Unit id uniqueness (regression).
 *
 * The old id scheme `${type}_${civId}_${liveCount}` reused ids once a unit died,
 * because `liveCount` came from the CURRENT array length (which shrinks when a
 * unit is removed). A new unit could then inherit the id of a still-alive unit,
 * and any removal-by-id (combat setTimeout, UnitTurnQueue.removeUnit, ...)
 * deleted BOTH units at once — units silently going missing.
