## üìú Core Mechanics

### City Management

**Founding Cities**
- Use Settler units to found new cities on suitable terrain
- City placement affects resources, defense, and growth potential
- Cities cannot be founded adjacent to existing cities

**City Growth**
- Cities grow by accumulating food surplus
- Population size affects production and science output
- Aqueduct required for cities to grow beyond size 10

**Production**
- Cities produce units, buildings, or wonders
- Production rate depends on terrain, population, and improvements
- Granary building reduces food needed for growth by 50%

**Happiness**
- Citizens can be Happy, Content, or Unhappy
- Too many unhappy citizens cause disorder (city produces nothing)
- Temples, Colosseums, and Wonders improve happiness
- Martial law (military units in city) can suppress unhappiness

### Technology Tree
